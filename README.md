# FEniCSx Based Fluid Solver

This repository contains the code developed as part of my master's thesis, focused on implementing a finite element solver for fluid flow using the [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) framework. The goal is to solve Stokes equations and to investigate the accuracy of higher-order elements.
